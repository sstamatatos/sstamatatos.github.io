<hr />

<h2 id="history">History:</h2>

<h4 id="the-tax-correction-group-was-founded-by-experts">The Tax Correction Group was founded by experts</h4>

<hr />

<p>The Tax Correction Group, LLC was founded by Sebastian Stamatatos in his junior year of high school. At that time, he discovered an interest in real estate and the housing market after performing an award-winning science research project on the correlation between over-assessment of a home&rsquo;s value and its days on market (DOM). While performing this research, Sebastian discovered some of the nuances of tax records and subsequently realized that even some of his neighbors were not taking full advantage of the exemptions available to them! Thus, the Tax Correction Group was formed to provide a service to the community, and to help Sebastian raise funds to further his education after high school.</p>

<h1 id="u-faq-u"><u>FAQ</u></h1>

<hr />

<h2 id="star-eligibility">STAR Eligibility</h2>

<p>The eligibility criteria are the same for both STAR credit and the STAR property tax exemption. You can&rsquo;t receive both the credit and the exemption.</p>

<h4 id="eligible-properties">Eligible properties</h4>

<ul>
<li>Houses, condominiums, cooperative apartments, manufactured homes, farm houses</li>
<li>mixed-use properties, including apartment buildings (though only the owner-occupied portion)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="eligible-homeowners">Eligible homeowners</h4>

<ul>
<li><strong>Residency</strong> &ndash; You must own your home and it must be your primary residence</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Basic STAR Eligibility</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Age</strong> &ndash; No Age Restriction</li>
<li><strong>Income</strong> &ndash; $500,000 or less annually*</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Enhanced STAR Eligibility</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Age</strong> &ndash; 65 or older**</li>
<li><strong>Income</strong> &ndash; $86,000 or less annually***</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="determining-your-primary-residence">Determining your primary residence</h4>

<p>The Tax Department may request proof of residency. Some factors that help determine whether a property is your primary residence include:</p>

<ul>
<li>voting</li>
<li>vehicle restrictions</li>
<li>length of time spent each year on the property</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="determining-your-income-eligibility">Determining your income eligibility</h4>

<p>Eligibility in 2018 is based on income information from the 2016 tax year. Income means federal &ldquo;adjusted gross income&rdquo; minus the &ldquo;taxable amount&rdquo; of total distributions from individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities (IRAs).</p>

<p><em>Special eligibility rules:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Surviving Spouses</strong> &ndash; You can retain an existing Enchanced STAR benefit if you&rsquo;re at least 62 years of age as of Decemer 31st in the year the benefit will continue. Otherwise, you may receive a Basic STAR benefit</li>
<li><strong>Nursing Home Residents</strong> &ndash; If you own your home, you&rsquo;re eligible for Basic or Enhanced STAR, as long as no one other than the co-owner or spouse resides there</li>
<li><strong>Trusts</strong> &ndash; If you are a trust beneficiary who conveyed your home to trustees but continues to live in the home, you get the STAR benefit; for example, a senior creates a trust and conveys her home to her children and trustees, but remains in the home as the beneficiary of the trust, and is therefore considered the homeowner (and therefore eligible for the STAR benefit)</li>
<li><strong>Life Estates</strong> &ndash; Under a life estate, one party has a &ldquo;life tenancy&rdquo; (ownership for the rest of his/her life) and another party will become the owner after the life tenant dies. For exemption purposes, the life tenant is deemed to own the property, and STAR eligibility is based on the life tenant&rsquo;s qualifications, so the home is eligible</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>*The income limit applies to the combined incomes of only the owners and owners&rsquo; spouses who reside at the property</p>

<p>**For jointly owned property, only one spouse or sibling must be over the age of 65 by December 31 of the year during which the exemption will begin</p>

<p>***The income limit applies to all owners, and any owner&rsquo;s spouse who resides at the property</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="1-has-the-star-program-been-abolished">1. Has the STAR program been abolished?</h3>

<p>No. There have been some changes to how certain homeowners will apply for STAR and to how the benefit is distributed to them, but the STAR program still exists.</p>

<h3 id="2-what-are-the-recent-changes-to-the-star-program">2. What are the recent changes to the STAR program?</h3>

<p>New applicants who qualify for STAR will register with New York State instead of applying with their assessor. If they qualify, they will receive a STAR credit in the form of a check, rather than receiving a property tax exemption. The dollar value of the credit will be the same as the property tax exemption.</p>

<h3 id="3-i-have-been-receiving-the-star-exemption-on-my-school-tax-bill-do-i-need-to-register-for-the-star-credit">3. I have been receiving the STAR exemption on my school tax bill. Do I need to register for the STAR credit?</h3>

<p>You need to register for the STAR credit if:</p>

<ul>
<li>you purchased your home after August 1, 2015, or</li>
<li>you purchased your home between May 1, 2014, and August 1, 2015, and

<ul>
<li>bought your home after the 2015 STAR application deadline, or</li>
<li>you did not apply for the STAR exemption on your home by the 2015 application deadline.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Otherwise, no action is necessary—you will continue to receive the STAR exemption on your school tax bill.</p>

<h3 id="4-do-i-need-to-register-for-the-star-exemption-every-year">4. Do I need to register for the STAR exemption every year?</h3>

<p>No. Once you&rsquo;ve registered, your eligibility for the credit will automatically be reivewed every year for as long as you continue to own and occupy your home.</p>
